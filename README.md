Coinsquare Assignment

The project has one main Wallet component, which is made up of 4 other sub components.

To run the application: run the server, install, and start the application.

1) node server.js
2) yarn install
3) yarn start

Server will be listening on port 3080 be default.

I've included some of testing via jest, to check that we can connect to the network via the given config.
To run the tests, simply type:

yarn test
